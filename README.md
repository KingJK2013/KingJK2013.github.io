A turn based strategy game built on typescript & HTML5, with a rouge-like tile set.
Previously written in Java with LibGDX, currently in the process of a complete rewrite.

## About

OpenCiv is a love letter to turn based strategy games inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization. The game strives to improve on certain aspects that were lacking in the series, and experiment with new features.
If you like game development, typescript, or pixel art, consider contributing. We can make something great.

Eventually, my main objective is to implement server-sided modding. Where the server would instruct the client to include modded units, terrain, and even custom UI elements.

## How do I build and run this?

The game isn't complete, so its not recommended:

To run a local instance, type `npm run install-all`, then `npm start` in the /OpenCiv/ directory

## How do I play this?

Currently the project is being rewritten, so no playable version is available. Check back in a few months!

`WASD` or `ARROW KEYS` or `LEFT-CLICK DRAG` - Camera Movement

`SCROLL` - Zoom In/Out

`LEFT-CLICK` Unit `RIGHT-CLICK` Tile - Unit Movement (In 2 tile radius)
