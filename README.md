A turn based strategy game built on typescript & HTML5, with a rouge-like tile set.

## About
OpenCiv is a love letter to turn based strategy games inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization. The game strives to improve on certain aspects that were lacking in the series, and experiment with new features. 
If you like game development, typescript, or pixel art, consider contributing. We can make something great. 

Eventually, I'd like to add support modding through [LUAJ](https://www.gamedevelopment.blog/using-luaj-scripting-to-allow-modding-in-games/).

## How do I build and run this?
The game isn't complete, so its not recommended, but if you want - 
To run a local instance, type ```npm run dev``` in the client directory,
then type ```npm start``` in the server directory.
