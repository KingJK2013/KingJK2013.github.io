A turn-based strategy game built on typescript & HTML5, with a rouge-like tile set.

## About

OpenCiv is a love letter to turn-based strategy games inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization. The game mainly focuses on Civ5 features and strives to improve on certain aspects that were lacking in the series.


The main objective of this project is to allow players who enjoy Civilization games to play it directly on a web browser.

## How do I build and run this?

The game isn't complete, so its not recommended:

To run a local instance, type `npm run install-all`, then `npm start` in the /OpenCiv/ directory

## How do I play this?

Currently the project is being rewritten, so no playable version is available. Check back in a few months!
